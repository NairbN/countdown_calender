# Frontend Docs (Countdown Calendar)

How we structure the frontend for web (Next.js) and future mobile (Expo/React Native), plus the shared data layer (API client + React Query hooks).

- [Structure](structure.md) — apps/packages layout and responsibilities.
- [Setup](setup.md) — workspace install, creating the Next.js app, wiring aliases/env, and tests command.
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md) — phased plan from scaffold to mobile prep, including shared hooks.
- [UI/UX plan](ui-ux.md) — page map, layout patterns, shared components to use/extend.
- [Web app guide](web-app.md) — how to run the Next.js app, mock vs live mode, and where pages live.
