# Countdown Calendar

This project has a FastAPI backend with Postgres. For backend setup, development, and API details, start with:

- [Backend Dev Guide](backend/docs/README.md)
- [Setup instructions](backend/docs/setup.md)
- [API reference](backend/docs/api.md)

## Root scripts
- `make up` — start Docker Compose (backend + db) and auto-stop on Ctrl+C.
- `make test-backend` — run backend tests (needs Postgres running or just make sure you ran make up without terminating it).

Frontend setup/docs: (add links when available).
